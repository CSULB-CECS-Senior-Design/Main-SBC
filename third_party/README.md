# Third Party Trackers
This directory contains third party trackers.

While the overall project has a permissive Apache 2.0 license, certain trackers
(especially those intended for research) have more restrictive licenses. These
trackers will be downloaded in install_requirements scripts and will notify of
the license used. Care should be taken if restrictive licenses are an issue.
